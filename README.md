## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Create a web platform called "EcoRecycle" that helps users find the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. The platform will also provide educational resources on the harmful effects of improper e-waste disposal and incentivize users to recycle by offering credit points based on the amount of precious metals recovered from their devices.
## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
Components:

1. Frontend Interface: User-facing web application where users can input their location, view nearby e-waste facilities, access educational content, and manage their accounts.
2. Backend Server: Handles user requests, processes data, and communicates with external APIs and databases.
3. Database: Stores information about e-waste facilities, user accounts, recycling statistics, and educational content.
4. External APIs: Integration with mapping APIs for location services, APIs for accessing e-waste facility data, and APIs for calculating credit points based on device models.
5. Educational Content Management System: Allows administrators to manage and update educational resources displayed on the platform.
## Use Cases
1. Finding Nearest E-Waste Facilities: Users can input their location and view a map displaying nearby e-waste collection and recycling facilities.
2. Accessing Educational Content: Users can access pop-ups or dedicated sections providing information about the harmful effects of e-waste and proper disposal methods.
3. Inputting Device Model for Credit Points: Users can input the model of their old device to receive credit points based on the amount of precious metals recovered.
4. Managing User Accounts: Users can create accounts, track their recycling history, and redeem rewards earned through recycling.
## Technology Stack
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for dynamic UI)
* Backend: Node.js with Express.js
* Database: MongoDB for flexibility in data storage
* Mapping API: Google Maps API for displaying e-waste facility locations
* Credit Points Calculation: Integration with a third-party API or service for calculating credit points based on device models
* Educational Content Management: Custom-built CMS or integration with existing CMS platforms like WordPress
## Dependencies
* Mapping API: Dependency on Google Maps API for location services and displaying e-waste facility locations.
* Third-Party APIs: Integration with APIs for credit points calculation and possibly for accessing e-waste facility data.
* Educational Content: Dependence on reliable sources for educational content on e-waste and environmental impact.
By implementing this solution, EcoRecycle can provide a user-friendly platform for responsible e-waste disposal, educate users on environmental issues, and incentivize sustainable behavior.
